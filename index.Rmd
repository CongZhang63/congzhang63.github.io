# Ciao a tutti!

Hi, it is great to meet you!

My name is Cong Zhang.  I'm a Master of Science graduate in Biostatistics (Public Health Data Science Track) at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.

Before coming to Columbia, I studied Bioengineering and Economics as my undergraduate majors at Xi’an Jiaotong University and Peking University respectively.

After graduating from Xi’an Jiaotong University, I worked as a Regional Manager and then a Product Specialist at Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. for about 2 years.  After graduating from Peking University, I worked as a Data Collection Intern and then a Senior Data Analyst at the Institute of Social Science Survey, Peking University for about 7 years, where we mainly focused on survey data of health and socioeconomics.

Right now, I’m working on the Data Science Institute Scholar Projects, and using statistical skills to analyze the associations between chronic exposure to air pollution and severity of COVID-19 outcomes and disparities in New York City.

I can speak Chinese, English, Spanish, and a little Portuguese and Italian.  I have 2 years’ experience in R & Python, as well as 8 years’ experience in SAS and SQL.  I’m also proficient in QGIS and GoeDa for spatial analysis.

# Data Science Projects

-> Professional Wine Reviews

I have completed a project regarding professional wine reviews with my friends. Please visit the project website for detailed information:

https://congzhang63.github.io/p8105_final_project

<br/>

-> Predicting Crime Rate

Together with my friends, I also built machine learning models (lasso regression, ridge regression, elastic net, random forests, etc.) to predict the crime rate within Boston area. Please refer to the project github for detailed information:

# My Hometown

#### Chongqing, the 3-D City of China!

I'm from Chongqing, China. Chongqing is a huge municipality located in the Southwest of China, and the core city area sits at the confluence of the Yangtze River and the Jialing River. Due to its unique terrain and weather, Chongqing is also well known among Chinese people as the "Mountain City" and the "Fog Municipality". Please enjoy the view!
