# Ciao a tutti!

Hi, it is great to meet you!

My name’s Cong Zhang. I'm a Master of Science candidate in Biostatistics (Public Health Data Science Track) at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.

Before coming to Columbia, I studied Bioengineering and Economics as my undergraduate majors at Xi’an Jiaotong University and Peking University respectively.

After graduating from Xi’an Jiaotong University, I worked as a Regional Manager and a Product Specialist at Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. for about 2 years.  After graduating from Peking University, I worked as a Data Collection Intern and then a Senior Data Analyst at the Institute of Social Science Survey, Peking University for about 7 years, where we mainly focused on survey data of health and socioeconomics.

Right now, I’m working on my practicum project, and using machine learning skills to analyze the genetic data which could be associated with kidney disease.

I can speak Chinese, English, Spanish, and a little Portuguese and Italian. I have 2 years’ experience in R & Python, as well as 5 years’ experience in SAS and SQL. I’m also familiar with QGIS and GoeDa for spatial analysis.

# My Hometown

#### Chongqing, the 3-D City of China!

I'm from Chongqing, China. Chongqing is a huge municipality located in the Southwest of China, and the core city area sits at the confluence of the Yangtze River and the Jialing River. Due to its unique terrain and weather, Chongqing is also well known among Chinese people as the "Mountain City" and the "Fog Municipality". Please enjoy the view!
