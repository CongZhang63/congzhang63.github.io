# My Hometown

#### Chongqing, the 3-D City of China!

I am from Chongqing, China. Chongqing is a huge municipality located in the Southwest of China, and the core city area sits at the confluence of the Long River and the Jialing River. Due to its unique terrain and weather, Chongqing is also well known among Chinese people as the "Mountain City" and the "Fog Municipality". Enjoy the view!

Here is my apartment, Baoli Jiangshang Mingzhu. You could clearly see how my community crawls all the way up the hills. This is very typical in Chongqing!
